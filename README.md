# tools
This is my collection of useful tools/scripts. I use some of these every day and some very infrequently. I wrote most of them.

### biotext
In dev, bottom terminal for reading in biology. shh!

Two row terminal. Only for xfce but can be adapted. bottom of the screen, always on top.

### coinflip
Blazing fast implementation of the time-tested "coin flip" algorithm. Prints "Heads" or "Tails".

### prime
Test if a number given as argument 1 is prime.

### printcsv
Does what it says on the tin. Not very good at what it does.

### pystiler
See the github repo; tiles windows on xfce4. Mostly useful for moving terminals around the screen.

### timeadd
Adds a timedelta to a time. Useful when you can't do basic math in your head.

### actualsize.py
Python script to recusively determine size of files/directories and show a window with the results. Useful to have in file manager right-click menu.

### backupfull.sh
In development, list of rsync excludes directories.

### commands.sh
Some useful or interesting commands that don't need their own script.

### getinstalled.sh
With a filesystem.manifest, show all the packages installed not in it.

### internet.sh
My school blocks pings, so I test for network connectivity through curl + a little bash

### java_cd_helper.sh
Spawns terminal in ~/Projects/javaclass

### jc
Opens terminals for my Java Class

### npm-upgrade.sh
Upgrades all installed npm packages

### percenterror.py
I always forget if it's actual-expected or expected-actual. This script remembers for me.

### pickone.py
Indecisive? This is a wheel spinner minus the wheel. Picks one of the arguments passed to it at random and prints it.

### playsrt.sh
Plays an srt file on it's own. Useful if watching a movie on the web and you can get a subtitle file.

### present.sh
Sets up computer for presenting via a projector.

### purgeremoved.sh
Bad way of purging files from uninstalled packages. But it works.

### remove_underscores.py
I had a program that didn't like underscores in filenames.

### unpresent.sh
Sets terminal settings back to normal after a present.sh

### working.rb
Nice script I found that makes it look like things are going on.
