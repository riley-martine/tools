# tools
This is my collection of useful tools/scripts. I wrote most of them.

## actualsize.py
Python script to recusively determine size of files/directories and show a window with the results. Useful to have in file manager right-click menu.

## backupfull.sh
In development, list of rsync excludes directories.

## biotext
In dev, bottom terminal for reading in biology. shh!

Two row terminal. For xfce but theoretically adaptable. bottom of the screen, always on top.

## coinflip
Blazing fast implementation of the time-tested "coin flip" algorithm. Prints "Heads" or "Tails."

## commands.txt
Useful or interesting commands that do not need their own script.

## getinstalled.sh
With a filesystem.manifest, show all the packages installed not in it.

## internet.sh
My school blocks pings, so I test for network connectivity through curl + a little bash

## java_cd_helper.sh
Spawns terminal in ~/Projects/javaclass

## jc
Opens terminals for my Java Class

## npm-upgrade.sh
Upgrades all installed npm packages

## pageadder.py
Given a page range in the form 11-12,15-33,56-58, a page number and what that number is in the pdf, outputs the same range with constants added, so it can be printed.

## percenterror.py
I always forget if you use actual-expected or expected-actual. This script remembers for me.

## pickone.py
Indecisive? This is a wheel spinner minus the wheel. Picks one of the arguments passed to it at random and prints it.

## playsrt.sh
Plays an srt file on its own. Useful if watching a movie on the web and you can get a subtitle file.

## present.sh
Sets up computer for presenting via a projector.

## prime
Test if a number given as argument 1 is prime.

## printcsv
Does what it says on the tin. Not great at what it does.

## purgeremoved.sh
Bad way of purging files from uninstalled packages. But it works.

## pystiler
See the github repo; tiles windows on xfce4. Useful for moving terminals around the screen.

## random-words
Get a number ($1, default 2) of random words joined with a dash. e.g "clover-stows-safariing-fancinesss" Used to name things automatically generated in a more interesting way than 001, 002, 003 or cxYubB76m, G66f8JlqV, 0PmwG1k1D.

## remove_underscores.py
I had a program that did not like underscores in filenames.

## timeadd
Adds a timedelta to a time. Useful when you cannot do basic math in your head.

## unpresent.sh
Sets terminal settings back to normal after a present.sh

## working.rb
Nice script I found that makes it look like work is going on.
